# dance-game-controller
A controller for dancing games like Dance Dance Revolution, In the Groove and Stepmania. 

# Templates
Routing templates for the panels are in */plans/routing_template_pads.svg*.
The template is created in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and has dedicated layers for the different parts of the template.
You may not want to have all layers present in the template you choose to use. Open the file in *Inkscape* and export a file
with only the layers you need.

The pads are 300mm x 300mm which is a bit larger than the Dance Dance Revolution arcade panels, which seem to be 274mm x 274mm.
